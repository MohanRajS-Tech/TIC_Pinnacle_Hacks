MVP Development Document: AI Event Co-Organizer with Optional Multi-Agent (Crew AI)
Objective

Build a hackathon-ready MVP that:

Takes minimal event inputs (title, date, notes)

Generates a task list with deadlines using Gemini API

Displays a futuristic, color-coded dashboard

Supports task completion toggle

Optional / Stretch Goal: Integrate Crew AI to create a multi-agent workflow for task generation, assignment, and dynamic updates if time permits.

Tech Stack
Layer	Technology / Tool	Notes
Frontend	React + Tailwind CSS	Smooth, futuristic UI with responsive design
Backend	Python (FastAPI / Flask)	Handles API calls to Gemini LLM and task processing
Database	Firebase Firestore	Store tasks, deadlines, and completion status
Hosting / Demo	Firebase Hosting	Local demo is sufficient
AI / LLM	Gemini API	Free-tier LLM for generating tasks and deadlines
Optional Multi-Agent	Crew AI Framework	Coordinate multiple AI agents for enhanced planning
System Architecture

Frontend (React)

Event input form: title, date, notes

Task dashboard: color-coded list of tasks

Task completion toggle: click to mark task as complete

Backend (Python + FastAPI/Flask)

Receives event input from frontend

Calls Gemini API LLM to generate tasks

Stores tasks in Firestore

Serves tasks back to frontend for display

Database (Firestore)

Collection: events

Document fields:

title (string)

date (string / timestamp)

notes (string)

tasks (array of objects):

task_name (string)

deadline (string / timestamp)

status (enum: pending/completed)

Optional Multi-Agent Flow (Crew AI)

Agents could handle:

Task Generation Agent → Gemini API to generate structured tasks

Deadline Planner Agent → Assign optimal deadlines based on event date

Assignment Agent → Suggest owners (placeholders) for tasks

Dashboard Updater Agent → Push updates and color-code tasks

Crew AI orchestrates these agents sequentially or in parallel

Only implement if time permits (can mock agents for demo)

Step-by-Step Development Plan
Step 1: Frontend Form

React component for event input:

Fields: Event Title, Date, Notes

Submit button triggers backend call

Validation: all fields required

Styling: futuristic UI (Tailwind animations, smooth hover effects)

Step 2: Backend API

Route: /generate-tasks (POST)

Input: JSON { title, date, notes }

Process:

Call Gemini API LLM with prompt to generate tasks + deadlines

Parse JSON response

Store tasks in Firestore

Output: JSON { event_id, tasks }

Step 3: Task Dashboard

Fetch tasks from Firestore for an event

Display as list:

Task name

Deadline

Status (color-coded: Pending = yellow, Completed = green)

Task completion toggle → update Firestore

Step 4: Firestore Integration

Store tasks as part of event document

Update task status on toggle

Optional: Realtime listeners for dynamic updates

Step 5: Optional Crew AI Integration

Set up multiple agents for:

Task generation

Deadline planning

Task assignment suggestions

Dashboard updates

Crew AI handles workflow orchestration, ensuring agents run in sequence

Can be mocked if hackathon time is limited

Step 6: Demo Flow

User enters event info

Frontend sends details → backend API

Gemini generates tasks → stored in Firestore

Dashboard displays tasks

User toggles tasks as complete

Optional: Crew AI agents orchestrate additional enhancements

Gemini API Prompt Design

Example Prompt:

You are an AI event planner. Event: "{title}" on {date} with notes: "{notes}". 
Generate 5 tasks needed to complete the event, each with a task name and a deadline. 
Return only JSON.

UI/UX Suggestions

Futuristic look: gradient backgrounds, smooth shadows, animated task toggles

Color-coded tasks:

Pending: Yellow / Amber

Completed: Green

Responsive: Works on desktop + mobile

Optional animation: Fade-in for new tasks, smooth checkmark for completed tasks

Intern Instructions / Tips

Focus only on minimum inputs (title, date, notes)

Ensure dashboard list + task completion toggle works

Use Gemini API free tier

No multi-user collaboration required for hackathon MVP

Host locally or Firebase Studio

Optional Crew AI: implement if time permits; otherwise mock agents

Stretch Goals (Hackathon Extras)

Simulated notifications for task deadlines

Task priority levels

Editing tasks manually on dashboard

Timeline view (mini-Gantt chart)

Crew AI multi-agent orchestration for automation

✅ Deliverable

Working MVP: User enters event → AI generates tasks → tasks appear on dashboard → toggle completion works

Optional: Crew AI multi-agent orchestration enhances the planning process
