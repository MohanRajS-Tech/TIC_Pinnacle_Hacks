# Explanation of the `start_backend.sh` script

This file explains the purpose and contents of the `start_backend.sh` script.

## Why We Created This Script

We originally tried to automate starting the backend server using the `onStart` hook in the `.idx/dev.nix` file. However, we ran into persistent errors that were preventing the workspace from starting correctly.

To get around this issue and avoid wasting more time on debugging the environment configuration, we moved the startup command into a simple shell script. This allows you to start the server manually with a short and easy-to-remember command, giving us a reliable way to get the backend running.

## The Command Explained

The `start_backend.sh` script contains the following command:

```bash
.venv/bin/python backend/main.py
```

Let's break down what this command does:

- **`.venv/bin/python`**: This part of the command executes the Python interpreter that is located inside the `.venv` directory. This is not the system's default Python; it's a specific Python interpreter for our project's **virtual environment**. We use this one because it's where we installed all our project's specific dependencies, like `Flask` and `crewai`. Using this interpreter ensures that our application has access to all the libraries it needs to run.

- **`backend/main.py`**: This is simply the path to the Python script we want to run. In this case, it's the main entry point for our Flask backend application.

In summary, the script starts your Flask application using the correct Python interpreter that has all the necessary libraries installed.
